Psammead is a package library which contains a mixture of components, containers and utilities.

Psammead packages are split into:

- [Components](./packages/components) - [GEL-compliant](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/articles/what-is-gel) presentational React components. They are ready for use out of the box, regardless of data source.
- [Containers](./packages/containers) - Functional components for optional use with presentational components of the same name.
- [Utilities](./packages/utilities) - Commonly shared Psammead dependencies, fundamentals to aid building additional GEL-compliant components, and aditional packages for use in building SPAs.

## :gift: Getting Started

### :airplane: Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:bbc/psammead.git
```

#### Install Yarn

The Psammead project uses Yarn for package management. It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system. To install Yarn, run this command:

```
npm install --global yarn
```

### :hammer: Setup Local Environment

```
cd psammead && yarn install:packages
```

N.B. When merging branches, the `yarn install:packages` command should be favoured over `yarn install`. [More details available here](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/pull/264).

### :runner: Run tests

Install dependencies locked to `yarn.lock`:

```
yarn install --immutable
```

(NB: You can't reliably run the jest tests when the packages are linked locally, as they may have been linked across breaking changes. Running `yarn install --immutable` resets all links. To update snapshots within unit tests, run `yarn test:unit -- -u`.)

Run the component tests:

```
yarn test
```

This runs Jest across any packages matching this glob pattern: `packages/components/**/*.test.jsx`. It also runs each package's `yarn test` command if it is defined

### :runner: Run Storybook

```
yarn storybook
```

NB, we've defined global styles (normalize, box-sizing, Reith font) in the [Storybook config](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/latest/.storybook/config.js) so that components render as expected.

### :construction_worker: Build Packages/Components

```
yarn build
```

### :computer: Developing with Psammead

<!-- This is both how to develop in psammead and how to use psammead and why is this in the components not packages readme? -->

## :rocket: Publishing Packages (only available for BBC staff as we publish via our corporate npm)

### :gear: Setting up your npm account

- Create an npm account with your bbc email address. https://www.npmjs.com
- In your npm profile settings, set up Two Factor Authentication. Enable it for authorization and publishing
- Back up your recovery codes for your account
- Join the BBC npm org by following the process here: https://github.com/bbc/npm When you're added to the org and signed in, you should be able to see all public and private `@bbc` packages here: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/bbc/packages

### :balloon: Publishing a package

Packages are published on merge into the `latest` branch via our CI process. The process defaults to publishing with `public` access and a tag of `latest`, however this can be overridden using configuration on your package json.

To stop your package from publishing to NPM add the following value to your `package.json`

```
"private": true,
```

The access and tag of the release can be overridden from the default values by adding the following values to your `package.json`

```
"publishConfig": {
  "access": "restricted",
  "tag": "alpha",
}
```

The access value is [restricted by NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#access) and can only be the values `public` and `restricted`.

### :roller_coaster: Deploying Storybook

The Psammead Storybook is hosted on GitHub pages at http://bbc.github.io/psammead. It is currently deployed via a local script that builds Storybook to the `gh-pages` git branch which is used by GitHub pages.

```
yarn deploy-storybook
```

NB, this automatically pushes to the 'gh-pages' branch, which deploys to the live GitHub pages site. Please only run this script on the `latest` branch.

### The name?

<img align="right" width="250" alt="Image of the Psammead from the BBC TV program Five Children and It (2004)" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/c1c9a6055cf3c6e4eb476a70186e597ea15e6cf7.jpg">

Pronounced as `sam-me-ad` 'sæmiː|æd

"The Psammead, also known as Sand Fairy, is a sapient magical creature once encountered by five children in a gravel pit".

It MIGHT stand for:

**P**erfectly **s**harable **a**tomically **m**odular **m**agically **e**ngineered **a**bstract **d**oodads

Or it _might_ be named Psammead to follow the mythical creature theme of [related repos](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh).

We'll let you decide!
