## Description

The Headings are a set of two components, `Headline` and `SubHeading`. They use a `h1` and `h2` HTML element respectively, with the `Headline` being designed for a single use on the page, with `SubHeading` being aimed at repeated use.

## Installation

`npm install @bbc/psammead-headings`

## Props

| Argument  | Type | Required | Default | Example |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| No props. |      |          |         |         |

## Usage

```jsx
import { Headline, SubHeading } from '@bbc/psammead-headings';

const Wrapper = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <Heading>Some headline</Heading>
    <SubHeading>Some subheadline</SubHeading>
  </Fragment>
);
```

All `SubHeading` components can be used as page anchors, with their ID being generated from their text, with any whitespace replaced with hyphens. To take the above usage as an example:

```
<SubHeading>Some subheadline</SubHeading>
```

This usage will allow for the page anchor: `www.bbc.com/news/articles/articleID#Some-subheadline`

### When to use this component

These components can be used at any point on the page, however the `Headline` is designed to be used once at the top of the page. The `SubHeading` adds an `id` value to the `h2` which can be used as an anchor when referencing content.

<!-- ### When not to use this component -->

### Accessibility notes

The `SubHeading` component has a tabindex of `-1` so that it works correctly with screen readers when navigated to via a skip link.
