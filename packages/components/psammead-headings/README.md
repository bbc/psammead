## Description

The Headings are a set of two components, `Headline` and `SubHeading`. They use a `h1` and `h2` HTML element respectively, with the `Headline` being designed for a single use on the page, with `SubHeading` being aimed at repeated use.

## When to use this component

These components can be used at any point on the page, however the `Headline` is designed to be used once at the top of the page. The `Subheadline` adds an `id` value to the `h2` which can be used as an anchor when referencing content.

## Accessibility notes

The `SubHeading` component has a tabindex of `-1` so that it works correctly with screen readers when navigated to via a skip link.
