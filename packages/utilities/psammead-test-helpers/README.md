This package provides a collection of helper methods for implementing Jest snapshot tests for styled-components, required by many Psammead components.

## Exported Functions

| Name                       | Arguments        | Description  |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| shouldMatchSnapshot        | title, component | Renders the component using react-test-renderer, converts it to JSON and asserts that it matches the given snapshot, which will be saved in the `__snapshots__` directory. The first argument `title` is the title for the test. |
| shallowRender              | component        |  Shallow renders the component using react-test-renderer and returns the render output |
| shouldShallowMatchSnapshot | title, component | Shallow renders the component using react-test-renderer and asserts that it matches the given snapshot, which will be saved in the `__snapshots__` directory. The first argument `title` is the title for the test. |
| isNull                     | title, component    | Renders the component using react-test-renderer, converts it to JSON and asserts that it is null. The first argument `title` is the title for the test. |
| testUtilityPackages                     | actualExports, expectedExports, utilityName | Compares an imported utility package and compares the exported values against a keyed object which validates that all the utilities exports are explicit. |

## Installation

```jsx
npm install react react-dom @bbc/psammead-test-helpers --save-dev
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { shouldMatchSnapshot } from '@bbc/psammead-test-helpers';

shouldMatchSnapshot(
  'should render correctly',
  <h1>Hello World</h1>,
);
```

## Roadmap

There is currently a plan to migrate from `react-test-renderer` to `enzyme` as it provides a nicer higher-level API over the same functionality, as well as having support for more granular unit tests.

## Contributing

When **adding** a new export to this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-test-helpers/index.test.jsx#L8-L14) also need to be updated and the export should be adding to the [README](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/tree/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-test-helpers#exported-functions). When **removing** an exisiting export from this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-test-helpers/index.test.jsx#L8-L14) need to be updated, the export should be removed from the [README](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/tree/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-test-helpers#exported-functions) and the package version requires a major change (EG: 1.2.1 -> 2.0.0) as this would be considered a breaking change due to functionality being removed.
